	1.-Should be better to use singleton for this implementation? Why?
	R.in the event that all objects created from a class should point to a single instance. 
	Such as an online sale all buyers should point to an instance of products that any 
	change is reflected in the other buyers
	
	2.-Explain which differences you see between both definitions?
	a it is used when we have a hard stage and the other is more flexible in case 
	you need to instantiate a new different object if needed so
